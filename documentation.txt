The Python program lightclock.py controls a Raspberry Pi's GPIO to control an
LED light strip to simulate the sunlight patterns of anywhere in the world.

Installation:

Set up and use a virtualenv if desired.  This program was written for Python 2.7
There are a number of required python modules.  Get them all by entering the
program's directory and running:
pip install -r requirements.txt


Flag help:

python lightclock.py -h
or
python lightclock.py --help


Usage:

python  lightclock.py [-h] (-a ADDRESS | -c LAT LON) [-t TIME] [-d DATE]

-h, --help          Show help message

-a ADDRESS, --address ADDRESS
                    Enter an address city, state, country, etc that you want to
                    simulate. If there is a space, you must use quotation marks.

-c LAT LON, --coords LAT LON
                    Enter a pair of numbers (LAT LON) to simulate. Should be two
                    floats separated by a space.

-t TIME, --time TIME
                    Enter a starting time to begin simulating. If omitted,
                    default to the current time.

-d DATE, --date DATE
                    Enter a starting date to begin simulating. If omitted,
                    default to current date.


Plug an LED lightstrip into GPIO 21 and ground.  Run the program. Watch the
lights dim on and off throughout a day.
